<div class="notes_block"> <h2><span style="font-weight: 400">What Is Raspberry Pi?</span></h2>
<p><strong>Raspberry Pi is defined as a minicomputer the size of a 
credit card that is interoperable with any input and output hardware 
device like a monitor, a television, a mouse, or a keyboard â 
effectively converting the set-up into a full-fledged PC at a low cost.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first generation of computers came
 as massive processing systems built with vacuum tube technology. Over 
the years, more compact and less expensive versions of what a computer 
would come to look like sprung up. Today, we have minicomputer gadgets 
such as smartphones in our pockets. Even though computers have become so
 commonplace, they are still not widely accessible in developing 
countries. This imbalance in access to computers and programming 
technology led to the development and creation of the Raspberry Pi 
computer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost, 
single-board computer the size of a credit card that allows people from 
different backgrounds and levels of expertise to experience and learn to
 compute. It is an enhanced motherboard developed in the United Kingdom 
by the Raspberry Pi foundation, now widely accepted as a part of 
evolving computer technology. The minicomputer can connect with other 
peripheral hardware devices such as a keyboard, mouse, and monitor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One can use Raspberry Pi for various purposes, including learning programming languages and orchestrating </span><a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/networking/articles/what-is-network-management/" title="network management."><span style="font-weight: 400">network management.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> It is multifunctional and gained even more popularity in the past few years than initially projected.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">How does Raspberry Pi work?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raspberry Pi is a programmable device.
 It comes with all the critical features of the motherboard in an 
average computer but without peripherals or internal storage. To set up 
the Raspberry computer, you will need an SD card inserted into the 
provided space. The SD card should have the operating system installed 
and is required for the computer to boot. Raspberry computers are 
compatible with Linux OS. This reduces the amount of memory needed and 
creates an environment for diversity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After setting up the OS, one can 
connect Raspberry Pi to output devices like computer monitors or a 
High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) television. Input units like
 mice or keyboards should also be connected. This minicomputerâs exact 
use and applications depend on the buyer and can cover many functions.</span></p></div>
