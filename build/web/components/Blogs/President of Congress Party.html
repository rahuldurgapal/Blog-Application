 early days of Rahul Gandhi did not witness a great exposure to the 
public sphere. Rahul Gandhi grew up under the watchful eyes of his 
family especially under the impeccable care of his mother Sonia Gandhi. 
As a boy, Rahul Gandhi focused on accomplishing his education. After the
 completion of his high school curriculum, he went abroad to have a 
vibrant educational experience. Amidst  his quest for knowledge, there 
were several instances of security threats to him especially after the 
inhumane assassination of his father Rajiv Gandhi who at the time was 
serving as the Prime Minister of India. After completing his higher 
education, Rahul Gandhi initiated his professional vocation with the 
Monitor Group, a management consulting firm in London. He subsequently 
returned to India and established a technology outsourcing firm called 
Backops Services Private Ltd. in Mumbai where he was one of the 
directors.</p><p>Overview of Rahul Gandhiâs education</p><p>The toddler 
years of Rahul Gandhi were spent in the National capital of Delhi and 
the serene hills of Dehradun. After attending St. Columbusâ School in 
New Delhi, Rahul Gandhi was enrolled in The Doon School of Dehradun in 
the state of Uttarakhand from 1981 to 1983. Rahul Gandhiâs father, Rajiv
 Gandhi had then entered into politics and had become the Prime Minister
 on  31st of October, 1984, after the assassination of Smt. Indira 
Gandhi. On account of the constant and numerous security threats faced 
by the Late Indira Gandhiâs family, both Rahul Gandhi and his sister 
Priyanka Gandhi were later schooled at home. Rahul Gandhi saw himself 
pursuing his undergraduate studies at St. Stephenâs College, University 
of Delhi before moving to Harvard University in the United States of 
America. In 1991, the country witnessed the harrowing assassination of 
Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India, who lost his life in an 
election rally. Due to security threats that followed the death of his 
father, Rahul Gandhi shifted to Rollins College in Florida where he 
graduated with a Bachelorâs Degree in 1994. He went on to pursue and 
complete his M.Phil from the Trinity College, Cambridge in the year 
1995.</p><p>Political journey of Rahul Gandhi</p><p>In March 2004 Rahul 
Gandhi announced his entry into Indian politics. Contesting from his 
father, Late Rajiv Gandhiâs constituency of Amethi, Rahul Gandhi managed
 a brilliant victory where he swept with an overwhelming margin of more 
than one lakh votes. Soon after, in his first interview to the foreign 
media as a political candidate, Rahul Gandhi vocally condemned the 
divisive politics indulged by the other parties where he promised to 
commit himself to become a binding force among all communities and 
parties and ease out the strains that arose from matters of caste and 
faith. On 24th of September during a reorganization of the party 
secretariats, Rahul Gandhi was appointed the General Secretary of the 
All India Congress Committee. He also took over the responsibilities of 
the National Studentsâ Union of India and the Indian Youth Congress; 
both of which witnessed an exponential growth under his leadership. He 
soon found himself to be the second in command as the Vice president of 
the Indian National Congress in January of 2013. Throughout his 
political journey, Rahul Gandhi has been an ardent representative of the
 underprivileged and the economically backward sections of society. On 
the 11th of May, 2011 in the village of Bhatta Parsaul in the state of 
Uttar Pradesh, he was arrested by the police for lending his support to 
the protesting farmers who were rightfully claiming a greater 
compensation on account of their land acquisition by the authorities for
 a highway project. 2014 elections witnessed a third term victory for 
Rahul Gandhi from Amethi. This victory, in its essence, represented the 
trust and faith that the people of his constituency had in him. Rahul 
Gandhi tirelessly directed his commitment to the efforts of the Indian 
National Congress for the betterment of the country and this earned him 
the post of the President of the Indian National Congress in 2017. Since
 then, the Indian National Congress under his leadership has arisen as a
 formidable force and the voice of  various stakeholders of the country.
 The vision of Rahul Gandhi and his strategy to fight the democratic 
battle with love and unity is what makes the Congress Party the true 
representative of a united India. Going forward, he aims to put these 
principles into action by creating systems that provide Indiaâs citizens
 with the tools and opportunities they need to reach their full 
potential.</p><p>Rahul Gandhi as the President of the Indian National Congress</p><p>The
 responsibilities of the President of the Indian National Congress were 
shouldered to Rahul Gandhi on the 16th of December, 2017. Since then, he
 has proved to be a strong voice of the opposition against the Bharatiya
 Janata Party led National Democratic Alliance under the Prime 
Ministership of Narendra Modi. Rahul Gandhi as the President of the 
largest opposition party has raised multiple issues where the focus is 
mainly on the betterment of the deprived sections of society. He has 
also been instrumental in keeping the ruling party on their toes by 
severely criticizing the various schemes and policies of the Modi led 
NDA government. Some of the NDA government policies against which Rahul 
Gandhi has been extremely vocal about are the hurried demonetization of 
2016 that hindered the Indian economic growth, the compulsory enrollment
 of every citizen of India under the Aadhar scheme, the Goods and 
Services Tax, the rising inflation and fuel prices, playing divisive 
politics among the people of India, failure of the Swachh Bharat Scheme 
and the Rafale scam among many others. The Congress under the leadership
 of Rahul Gandhi have severely criticized the Modi led NDA government to
 be pro-rich where they submit to the demands of the capitalists, 
industrialists and the Multinational Corporations without paying heed or
 addressing to the hardships faced by the farmers and the impoverished 
of the country.</p><p><br></p></div></div>
