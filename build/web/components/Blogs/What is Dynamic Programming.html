<div class="notes_block"> <p>Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/">recursion</a>.
  Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same 
inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to 
simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to 
re-compute them when needed later.  This simple optimization reduces 
time complexities from exponential to polynomial.</p>
<p>For example, if we write simple recursive solution for <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-nth-fibonacci-number/">Fibonacci Numbers</a>,
 we get exponential time complexity and if we optimize it by storing 
solutions of subproblems, time complexity reduces to linear.</p>
