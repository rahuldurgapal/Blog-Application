 has been the focus of my life's work, as for many of my research 
colleagues. Ever since programming AI for computer games as a teenager, 
and throughout my years as a neuroscience researcher trying to 
understand the workings of the brain, Iâve always believed that if we 
could build smarter machines, we could harness them to benefit humanity 
in incredible ways.</p><p data-block-key="i7i7">This promise of a world 
responsibly empowered by AI continues to drive our work at Google 
DeepMind. For a long time, weâve wanted to build a new generation of AI 
models, inspired by the way people understand and interact with the 
world. AI that feels less like a smart piece of software and more like 
something useful and intuitive â an expert helper or assistant.</p><p data-block-key="98mu4">Today, weâre a step closer to this vision as <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini" target="_blank" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini&quot;}">we introduce Gemini</a>, the most capable and general model weâve ever built.</p><p data-block-key="aka6e">Gemini
 is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across 
Google, including our colleagues at Google Research. It was built from 
the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and 
seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of 
information including text, code, audio, image and video.</p></div>
