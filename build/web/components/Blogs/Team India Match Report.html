 being troubled by a couple of short balls, Iyer lofts one down the

 Bumrahâs 6 for 61 paved the way for Indiaâs seven-wicket win on the 
second day of the second Test in Cape Town, enabling them to level the 
two-match series 1-1.</div><p></p><p class="ds-text-comfortable-m ds-my-4 ci-html-content"></p><div>After
 South Africa were bowled out for 176 in their second innings, India 
chased down the required 79 runs an hour before tea. Lasting just 107 
overs, this was the shortest Test ever to produce a result. It was also 
India's first Test win at Newlands in seven attempts.</div><p></p><p class="ds-text-comfortable-m ds-my-4 ci-html-content"></p><div>But
 before all that, Aiden Markram scored a stunning hundred â 106 off 103 
balls. It was the first time in Test history that a batter scored a 
hundred where none of his team-mates reached 20 in either innings; Kyle 
Verreynne's 15 in the first innings was the next best for South Africa. 
Unfortunately for Markram and Dean Elgar, who retires after this Test, 
it ended in a losing cause.</div><p><br></p></div></div>
