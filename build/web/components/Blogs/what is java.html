               <p>Java is a widely-used programming language for coding 
web applications. It has been a popular choice among developers for over
 two decades, with millions of Java applications in use today. Java is a
 multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can 
be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable 
programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and 
enterprise software to big data applications and server-side 
technologies.</p>

               <h2>What is Java programming language used for?&nbsp;</h2> 
               <p>Because Java is a free-to-use and a versatile 
language, it builds localized and distributed software. Some common uses
 of Java include:</p> 
               <h3>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; Game Development</h3> 
               <p>Many popular mobile, computer, and video games are 
built in Java. Even modern games that integrate advanced technology like
 machine learning or virtual reality are built with Java technology.</p> 
               <h3>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; Cloud computing</h3> 
               <p>Java is often referred to as WORA â Write Once and Run
 Anywhere, making it perfect for decentralized cloud-based applications.
 Cloud providers choose Java language to run programs on a wide range of
 underlying platforms.</p> 
               <h3>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; Big Data</h3> 
               <p>Java is used for data processing engines that can work with complex data sets and massive amounts of real-time data.</p> 
               <h3>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; Artificial Intelligence</h3> 
               <p>Java is a powerhouse of machine learning libraries. 
Its stability and speed make it perfect for artificial intelligence 
application development like natural language processing and deep 
learning.</p> 
               <h3>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; Internet of Things</h3> 
               <p>Java has been used to program sensors and hardware in edge devices that can connect independently to the internet.</p> 
              </div></div></div></div><div class="lb-none-v-margin lb-grid lb-small-pad lb-grid" data-eb-item-id="seo-faq-pairs#why-is-java-such-a-popular-choice-among-modernday-software-developers"><div class="lb-row lb-row-max-large lb-snap"><div class="lb-col lb-tiny-24 lb-mid-24"><h2 class="lb-txt-bold lb-txt-none lb-txt-28 lb-h2 lb-title" id="seo-faq-pairs#why-is-java-such-a-popular-choice-among-modernday-software-developers">Why is Java such a popular choice among modern-day software developers?</h2><div class="lb-txt-14 lb-rtxt"> 
               <p>Java is popular because it has been designed for ease 
of use. Some reasons developers continue to choose Java over other 
programming languages include:</p> 
               <h3>High quality learning resources</h3> 
               <p>Java has been around for a long time, so many learning
 resources are available for new programmers. Detailed documentation, 
comprehensive books, and courses&nbsp;support developers through the learning
 curve. In addition, beginners can start writing code in Core Java 
before moving to Advanced Java.</p> 
               <h3>Inbuilt functions and libraries</h3> 
               <p>When using Java, developers donât need to write every 
new function from scratch. Instead, Java provides a rich ecosystem of 
in-built functions and libraries to develop a range of applications.&nbsp;</p> 
               <h3>Active community support</h3> 
               <p>Java has many active users and a community that can 
support developers when they face coding challenges. The Java platform 
software is also maintained and updated regularly.</p> 
               <h3>High-quality development tools</h3> 
               <p>Java offers various tools to support automated 
editing, debugging, testing, deployment, and change management. These 
tools make Java programming time and cost-efficient.</p> 
               <h3>Platform Independent</h3> 
               <p>Java code can run on any underlying platform like 
Windows, Linux, iOS, or Android without rewriting. This makes it 
especially powerful in todayâs environment, where we want to run 
applications on multiple devices.</p> 
               <h3>Security</h3> 
               <p>Users can download untrusted Java code over a network 
and run it in a secure environment in which it cannot do any harm. 
Untrusted code cannot infect the host system with a virus nor can it 
read or write files from the hard drive. The security levels and 
restrictions in Java are also highly configurable.</p>

               <p>All programming languages are a means to communicate 
with machines. Machine hardware only responds to electronic 
communication. High-level programming languages like Java act as a 
bridge between human language and hardware language. To use Java, a 
developer needs to understand two things:</p> 
               <h3>1. Java language and APIs</h3> 
               <p>This is the front-end communication between the developer and the Java platform.</p> 
               <h3>2. Java Virtual Machine</h3> 
               <p>This is the back-end communication between the Java 
platform and the underlying hardware. Letâs look at each of these in 
detail below.</p>

               <p>Java defines the syntax and semantics of the Java 
programming language. This includes the basic vocabulary and rules used 
to write algorithms such as primitive data types, if/else blocks, loops,
 etc.</p> 
               <p>APIs are important software components bundled with 
the Java Platform. These are pre-written Java programs that can plug and
 play existing functionality into your own code. For example, you could 
use Java APIs to get the date and time, perform mathematical operations,
 or manipulate text.&nbsp;</p> 
               <p>Any Java application code written by a developer will 
typically combine new and pre-existing code from Java APIs and Java 
libraries.</p>

               <p>The Java Virtual Machine acts as an additional 
abstraction layer between the Java platform and the underlying machine 
hardware. Java source code can run only on those machines that have JVM 
installed on them. The answer to why the Java Virtual Machine is needed 
lies in the history of programming.</p>

               <p>When natural programming languages were first 
developed, they fell into two broad categories, depending on how they 
communicated with the underlying hardware.</p> 
               <ol><li><strong>Compilers:&nbsp;</strong>The complete program is 
written in natural English-like syntax with compilers, and&nbsp;the language 
then compiles (or translates) the entire code into machine code. The 
compiled code is then run on the hardware.</li><li><strong>Interpreters:&nbsp;</strong>With interpreters, 
every high-level code statement is interpreted into machine code on the 
fly.&nbsp; Written statements are run immediately by the hardware before 
looking at the next statement.</li></ol>

               <p>The Java program was the first language to combine 
both methods above using a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The Java code 
compiler is called the Java Virtual Machine. Any Java file is first 
compiled into bytecode. Java bytecode can only run in the JVM. The JVM 
then interprets the bytecode to run it on the underlying hardware 
platform. So if the application is running on a Windows machine, the JVM
 will interpret it for Windows. But if it is running on an open-source 
platform like Linux, the JVM will interpret it for Linux.&nbsp;</p>

               <p>To begin programming in Java, you need to install a Java Edition on your system. There are four main Java editions:&nbsp;</p> 
               <ol><li>Java Standard Edition (Java SE)</li><li>Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)</li><li>Java Micro Edition (Java ME)</li></ol> 
               <h3>What is Java SE?</h3> 
               <p>Java Standard Edition is the core Java programming 
platform. It contains all of the libraries and APIs that any programmer 
needs for java development. Open Java Development Kit(OpenJDK) is the 
free and open source implementation of Java SE.</p></div>
